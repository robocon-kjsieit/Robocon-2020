# Robocon-2020
ABU ROBOCON 2020 FIJI
Contest Theme “ROBO RUGBY 7s”

The ABU Robocon 2020 Suva contest is to play rugby 7’s game using two robots and five obstacles as five defending players. The highlight of this game is how the two robots collaborate to score Try and the Goal Kick. The main and unique challenge of this game will be Goal Kick, kicking the Kick Ball over the cross bar of the conversion post because of the unique shape of the rugby ball. The audience will be fascinated if the robot made all the Goals successfully.
